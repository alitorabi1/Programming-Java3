WAYS TO DECOMPOSE A TASK INTO METHODS OR CLASSES

1. If you're performing an operation multiple
times and it takes many lines of code.
Instead of copy&paste (code duplication)
create a reusable method.

int inputNumericalGrade()

2. Single responsibility

DO NOT DO THIS - two functionalities in one method:
double addOrPrint(double v1, double v2, boolean print)

DO THIS INSTEAD:
double add(double v1, double v2)
void printTwoDoubles(double v1, double v2)

3. Stages of execution

Stage 1: getInputs()
Stage 2: analyze (may be multiple methods)
Stage 3: output the results

4. Layers of program - usually one or more classes per layer.
Example layers: Model / View / Controller
