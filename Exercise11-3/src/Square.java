    Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer
    m and find the smallest integer n such that m * n is a perfect square. (Hint:
    Store all smallest factors of m into an array list. n is the product of the factors that
    appear an odd number of times in the array list. For example, consider m = 90,
    store the factors 2, 3, 3, 5 in an array list. 2 and 5 appear an odd number of times
    in the array list. So, n is 10.) Here are sample runs:
